At each iteration worker performs the following steps: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Read master variable $z$
	\item Compute an update locally
	\item Update master variable $z$
\end{enumerate}

Let increment time $k$ when a worker starts reading the vector. Let us suppose that at time $k$ only one reading is possible. $d^i_k \ \text{and} \ D^i_k$ have the same meaning as in DaVE-RPG paper.
